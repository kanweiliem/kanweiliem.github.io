        <p align="center">I am Kan Wei Liem, known as William. Born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, I am a diploma student at the Dasein Academy of Art. As an art student, I prioritize meaning and depth over aesthetics. While many can create beautiful art, I aim to produce work with creativity and significance that conveys messages.Inspiration comes from various sources: events, phrases, experiences, films, and manga. I don’t limit myself to one style but blend multiple styles to create unique and compelling pieces. My preferred themes are street art, cyberpunk, and psychedelic styles. My art is detailed and immersive, drawing viewers into my imaginative world.
            </p>
        <p align="center"> Through my journey, I’ve learned that art must have a soul an idea, memory, or social phenomenon to endure. Art has unlimited potential, bringing joy and preserving memories. To me, art equals infinity, and I’m dedicated to exploring its limitless possibilities.My creative process involves extensive research to ensure my work is flawless and engaging. I believe art should provoke thought and resonate with viewers.
